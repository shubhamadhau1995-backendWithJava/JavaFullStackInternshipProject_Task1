Java Full-stack web project using HTML, CSS, and Spring Boot to handle contact form submissions.

Java Full Stack Web Development Internship – Task 1
Landing Page + Contact Form

This project is part of the Java Full Stack Web Development Internship – Task 1.
The goal of this task is to build a modern landing page with a contact form and connect it to a Java Spring Boot backend to handle form submissions.

📌Task Overview
This is a beginner-friendly full-stack project where:
The frontend collects user input through a contact form.
The backend receives and processes the data using Spring Boot.
Submitted data is printed in the console (no database integration yet).
This project demonstrates the complete frontend-to-backend workflow.

🛠️ Technologies Used
    Frontend
    HTML
    CSS
    Backend
    Java
    Spring Boot
    REST Controller (POST request handling)

📋 Features
Responsive landing page UI
Contact form with:
Name
Email
Message

Form submission handled by Spring Boot controller
Submitted data printed to the backend console

📂 Project Structure (Basic)
├── frontend
│   ├── index.html
│   └── style.css

🚀 How to Run the Project
Backend (Spring Boot)
Open the backend project in IDE like Spring Tool Suite.
Run the Spring Boot application.
Server will start on:
http://localhost:8081

Frontend
Open index.html in a browser.
Fill in the contact form and submit.
Check the backend console to see submitted data.

🎯 Skills Gained
HTML & CSS for landing page design
Form handling in HTML
Spring Boot project setup
Handling POST requests using controllers
Understanding full-stack data flow

📖 Future Enhancements
Add database integration (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
Form validation
Success/error response messages
REST API response handling
Deployment to cloud platform

🏁 Conclusion
This task serves as a foundation for full-stack Java development, 
helping to understand how frontend and backend communicate in real-world applications.
